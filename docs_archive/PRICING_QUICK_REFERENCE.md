## Key Principles

### 1. Coaching is 1-to-1 by Default
- Coaches manage individual clients, not families
- Clean separation between professional and personal use
- 1% commission per client transaction

### 2. Families are a Separate Use Case
- Family features are for household management
- Parents manage their own family members
- No overlap with professional coaching tools

### 3. WIHY AI Fills Scalability Gaps
- Available to all user types as add-on
- Included in premium tiers (Family Premium, Coach + Family)
- Works across all contexts (Personal, Family, Coach)
- Not tied to a specific role or plan

### 4. Navigation is Capability-Based
- Personal tab: Always visible (everyone)
- Family tab: Only if family plan enabled
- Coach tab: Only if coach platform enabled
- AI/Instacart: Show locked state or enabled based on plan

### 5. Everyone Keeps Personal Dashboard
- Coaches use WIHY for their own health
- Parents track their own fitness while managing family
- Professional/family features layer on top, don't replace

## Common Questions

**Q: If I'm a coach, do I lose my personal dashboard?**
A: No! Coaches get BOTH personal and professional dashboards. You use WIHY for your own health while managing clients.

**Q: Can coaches manage families?**
A: Not by default. Coaches manage individual clients 1-to-1. If a coach also wants family features for their own household, they can purchase the Coach + Family Bundle.

**Q: Is WIHY AI included in my plan?**
A: It depends:
- Free, Premium, Family Basic, Coach: No (available as add-on)
- Family Premium, Coach + Family: Yes (included)

**Q: Do I need Instacart to use meal planning?**
A: No! Meal planning works perfectly without Instacart. Instacart just adds convenient grocery ordering buttons.

**Q: Can I switch between dashboards?**
A: Yes! If you have multiple dashboards (e.g., Coach + Family), you'll see tabs at the top to switch between Personal, Family, and Coach contexts.

**Q: What's the difference between a human coach and WIHY AI?**
A: Human coaches ($29.99/month) are professionals who manage client programs. WIHY AI (add-on or included) is a digital assistant that helps create meal plans and workouts. They work together!
